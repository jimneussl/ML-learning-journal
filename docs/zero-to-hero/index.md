# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

To kick off my engineering learning journey, I'm starting with Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero] series.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

In this series, he covers the foundations of neural networks and builds various models from scratch. He starts with [micrograd], an autograd engine that implements backpropagation, continues with [makemore], an autoregressive character-level language model, and ends with building [GPT] and [GPT tokenizers].

As I go through the series, I code along each video to recreate the models and note down learnings, tips, and tricks. The outcome of each part of the series should be a file with my replicated code and call-outs for specific code sections and general learnings.
