# My ML/AI Learning Journal & Portfolio

This repository contains my code, notes, and projects as I learn ML and AI, starting with Andrej Karpathy's 'Zero to Hero' series and expanding from there.

You can find my documented learning journey, detailed notes, and portfolio pieces on my GitHub Pages site: [ML learning journal](https://jimneussl.github.io/ml-learning-journal/)
